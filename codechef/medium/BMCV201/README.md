## Problem

### Basic math - Addition and multiplication

Basic math and logic based programming problems are the correct starting point for  **Beginners**.

- In the previous module, we have learnt how to accept multiple inputs and test cases
- The current module will use our knowledge of C++ syntax and learnings from the previous module
### Task

Lets start with a simple problem - you need to write a program which does the following

- Accepts the number of inputs / test cases as '$t$' The only line of each test case contains 2 integers - declare them as variables $A$ and $B$
- For each test case, you need to perform the following operations Create a variable - $S$ - the sum of the 2 input integers Create a variable - $P$ - the product of the 2 input integers Output 2 space separated integers - $S$ and $P$ in a single line

 **Note:** 

- The syntax for product of 2 integers in C++ is ($X$ * $Y$)
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
5 10
3 4
```

```
15 50
7 12
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case 1** : The 2 integers are $5$ and $10$ and we output $15$ as their sum and $50$ as their product

 **Test case 2** : The 2 integers are $3$ and $4$ - we output $7$ and $12$ as their sum and product respectively

## Solution

**Language:** c_cpp  
**Runtime:** N/A  
**Memory:** N/A

```c_cpp
// Solution as follows
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--)
    {
        int A, B, S, P;
        cin >> A >> B;;
        //Sum of inputs
        S = A + B;
        //Product of inputs
        P = A * B;
        //Print the desired output for each test case
        cout << S << " " << P << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
